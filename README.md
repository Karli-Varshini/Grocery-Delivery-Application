**Overview of the Grocery Delivery Application:**
**Objective:**
The Grocery Delivery Application is designed to provide users with a simple and convenient way to browse, select, and order grocery items online. The application allows users to view available grocery items, add them to a virtual shopping cart, and place an order. The main goal is to streamline the online grocery shopping experience, making it user-friendly and efficient.

**Technology Used:**
**Java Swing:** The application is built using Java Swing, a GUI toolkit that provides a platform-independent way to create graphical user interfaces. The use of Swing allows for the creation of a rich and interactive user interface.

**CardLayout:** This layout manager is used to manage different screens (panels) within the application, such as browsing groceries, viewing the cart, and checking out. It enables smooth transitions between different sections of the application.

**Collections (HashMap):** The application uses Java's HashMap to store the grocery items along with their prices and to keep track of the items added to the cart. This provides efficient data management and quick access to item details.

**The application features three main panels:**

**BrowsePanel:** Displays the available grocery items and allows users to add items to their cart.

**CartPanel:** Shows the items currently in the user's cart, along with their quantities and total cost.

**OrderPanel:** Provides a summary of the user's order and an option to return to the browsing screen.

This structure ensures a seamless user experience, from browsing products to finalizing an order.
